### Getting Started
- The easiest way to activate the `Dracula.less` stylesheet is to open the TaskPaper Stylesheet folder through the application: `Window > StyleSheet > Open StyleSheet Folder`.

- Then copy (or link) `Dracula.less` into this folder.

- You can set the stylesheet of `Dracula Sample.taskpaper` with `Window > StyleSheet > Dracula.less` and watch the document refresh as you customize `Dracula.less`.

- For additional formatting, you can set the scripts to run with a periodic/keystroke trigger (`osascript -l`, Keyboard Maestro JXA action, etc.).

### Font
- As pictured above, `Dracula.less` uses [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono), a paid monospaced font.

- However, it will default to the System Font if you don't have that typeface, and you can set any font you like in `Dracula.less`.
